       " 'i love love love this jumpsuit it fun flirty and fabulous every time wear it get nothing but great compliments ',\n",
       " 'this shirt is very flattering to all due to the adjustable front tie it is the perfect length to wear with leggings and it is sleeveless so it pairs well with any cardigan love this shirt ',\n",
       " 'i love tracy reese dresses but this one is not for the very petite am just under feet tall and usually wear p in this brand this dress was very pretty out of the package but its lot of dress the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame not stranger to alterations shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me returned this dress ',\n",
       " 'i aded this in my basket at hte last mintue to see what it would look like in person store pick up went with teh darkler color only because am so pale hte color is really gorgeous and turns out it mathced everythiing was trying on with it prefectly it is little baggy on me and hte xs is hte msallet size bummer no petite decided to jkeep it though because as said it matvehd everything my ejans pants and the skirts waas trying on of which kept all oops ',\n",
       " 'i ordered this in carbon for store pick up and had ton of stuff as always to try on and used this top to pair skirts and pants everything went with it the color is really nice charcoal with shimmer and went well with pencil skirts flare pants etc my only compaint is it is bit big sleeves are long and it doesn go in petite also bit loose for me but no xxs so kept it and wil ldecide later since the light color is already sold out in hte smallest size ',\n",
       " 'i love this dress usually get an xs but it runs little snug in bust so ordered up size very flattering and feminine with the usual retailer flair for style ',\n",
       " 'i and lbs ordered the petite to make sure the length wasn too long typically wear an xs regular in retailer dresses if you re less busty cup or smaller s petite will fit you perfectly snug but not tight love that could dress it up for party or down for work love that the tulle is longer then the fabric underneath ',\n",
       " 'dress runs small esp where the zipper area runs ordered the sp which typically fits me and it was very tight the material on the top looks and feels very cheap that even just pulling on it will cause it to rip the fabric pretty disappointed as it was going to be my christmas dress this year needless to say it will be going back ',\n",

       " 'more and more find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past they are right on in their estimation of the product in the case of this dress if it had not been for the reveiws doubt would have even tried this the dress is beautifully made lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality it is lined in the solid periwinkle colored fabric that matches the outer fabric print tts and very form fitting falls just above the knee and does not rid',\n",
       " 'bought the black xs to go under the larkspur midi dress because they didn bother lining the skirt portion grrrrrrrrrrr my stats are and the xs fit very smoothly around the chest and was flowy around my lower half so would say it running big the straps are very pretty and it could easily be nightwear too m and it came to just below my knees ',\n",
       " 'this is nice choice for holiday gatherings like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings the size small fit me well am usually size with small bust in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up but then perhaps the waist will be too big the problem with this dress is the quality the fabrics are terrible the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip',\n",
       " 'i took these out of the package and wanted them to fit so badly but could tell before put them on that they wouldn these are for an hour glass figure am more straight up and down the waist was way too small for my body shape and even if sized up could tell they would still be tight in the waist and too roomy in the hips for me that said they are really nice sturdy linen like fabric pretty color well made hope they make someone very happy ',\n",
       " 'material and color is nice the leg opening is very large am and the length hits me right above my ankle with leg opening the size of my waist and hem line above my ankle and front pleats to make me fluffy think you can imagine that it is not flattering look if you are at least average height or taller this may look good on you ',\n",
       " 'took chance on this blouse and so glad did wasn crazy about how the blouse is photographed on the model paired it whit white pants and it worked perfectly crisp and clean is how would describe it launders well fits great drape is perfect wear tucked in or out can go wrong ',\n",
       " 'a flattering super cozy coat will work well for cold dry days and will look good with jeans or dressier outfit am about and the small fits great ',\n",

       " 'if this product was in petite would get the petite the regular is little long on me but tailor can do simple fix on that fits nicely m lb and pregnant so bough medium to grow into the tie can be front or back so provides for some nice flexibility on form fitting ',\n",
       " 'i upset because for the price of the dress thought it was embroidered no that is print on the fabric think cried little when opened the box it is still ver pretty would say it is true to size it is tad bit big on me but am very tiny but can still get away with it the color is vibrant the style is unique skirt portion is pretty poofy keep going back and forth on it mainly because of the price although the quality is definitely there except wish it were emb',\n",
       " 'first of all this is not pullover styling there is side zipper wouldn have purchased it if knew there was side zipper because have large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me second of all the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath not at all what is looks like or is described as sadly will be returning but m sure will find something to exchange it for ',\n",
       " 'cute little dress fits tts it is little high waisted good length for my height like the dress m just not in love with it dont think it looks or feels cheap it appears just as pictured ',\n",
       " 'i love this shirt because when first saw it wasn sure if it was shirt or dress since it is see through if you wear it like dress you will need slip or wear it with leggings bought slip wore the tie in the back and rocked it with white wedges you could also wear it as vest be careful with the buttons haven had any fall off yet but feel like they will overall it great for any occasion and it fun to wear ',\n",
       " 'loved the material but didnt really look at how long the dress was before purchased both large and medium im and there was atleast of material at my feet the gaps in the front are much wider than they look felt like the dress just fell flat both were returned im usually large and the med fit better in jeans',\n",
       " 'i have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and was so excited for it to arrive this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat the sleeves are very wide although long as light weight fall coat the sleeves don need to be as wide because you wouldn be layerng too much underneath the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for nicer fit thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with tigh',\n",
       " 'the colors weren what expected either the dark blue is much more vibrant and just couldn find anything to really go with it fabric is thick and good quality has nice weight and movement to it the skirt just wasn for me in the end ',\n",
       " 'i have several of goodhyouman shirts and get so many compliments on them especially the one that says forehead kisses are underrated don hesitate buy this shirt you won be sorry ',\n",
       " 'this sweater is so comfy and classic it balances quirky hand knit look with beautiful color and practical fit it is bit cropped and boxy as part of the style and as others mentioned there are gaps in the knit that make it see through in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering like having longer camisole showing underneath or wearing it over little dress it warm but still thin enough to fit under jacket or coat ',\n",
       " 'beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these ',\n",
       " 'i never would have given these pants second look online in person they are much cuter the stripes are brighter and the fit more flattering the crop has cute flare which is right on trend this brand has always run small for me am about lbs and carry some chubbiness in the belly paired it with collarless loose navy blazer',\n",
       " 'these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned ',\n",
       " 'i ordered this months ago and it finally came off back order huge disappointment the fit wasn so much the issue for me the quality of the wool is subpar someone else mentioned quot felted wool quot guess is that what you call it it does literally feel like felt super thin itchy doesn drape very well and feels cheap made in china got it on sale but still not worth what paid definitely going back ',\n",
       " 'this is such neat dress the color is great and the fabric is super soft am tall so the long length was an added bonus it definitely needs something underneath since the front gaps am going to pair it with funky tank top necklaces and boots super cute ',\n",
       " 'wouldn have given them second look but tried them on in store of whim love love ',\n",
       " 'this is comfortable skirt that can span seasons easily while not the most exciting design it is good work skirt that can be paired with many tops ',\n",
       " 'just ordered this in small for me size and medium for my mom size and it is gorgeous beautifully draped all the weight warmth ll need for houston fall and winter looks polished snapped or unsnapped age appropriate for both my mom and myself will look amazing with skinny jeans or leggings we ordered the gray which is true to the photos ',\n",

       " 'tried this on today at my local retailer and had to have it it is so comfortable and flattering it too bad the picture online has the model tucking it into the skirt because you can see the ruching across the front little dressier alternative to plain tee and reasonably priced for retailer and generally wear the small fit well will probably be back for the black ',\n",
       " 'i bought this item from online the fit on the model looked little loose but when got mine it seemed bit tight so took it back to the store ordered larger size for the sale price this is great top ',\n",

       " 'this is cute top that can transition easily from summer to fall it fits well nice print and it comfortable tried this on in the store but did not purchase it because the color washed me out this is not the best color for blonde would look much better on brunette if this was in different color most likely would have purchased it ',\n",

       " 'nice top armholes are bit oversized but as an older woman m picky about that the print is pretty and unusual it just didn look great on me there a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely it a lightweight tee fabric that opaque tried it on with black bra which was barely visible great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now that decided to return since summer is winding down do recommend ',\n",
       " 'this is an adorable top that find to be extremely comfortable don usually buy prints but this one is so feminine and looks great with dark wash jeans am d and the medium was perfect fit ',\n",

       " 'i got this in the petite length size and it fit just right like that didn have to have it altered in the length can wear with flats with plenty of clearance to the floor from the bottom hem my only beef with the design is the height of the waist personally think that the elastic waistband looks cheap and really needs to be concealed with belt yet because it sits so high literally right under the bustline it a tricky one to pull off have wide belt that sort of does th',\n",
       " 'i ve been looking for bralettes that provide some support but not binding tight for night time and casual wear this is light weight bra could be little more supportive pretty color with nice lines only downside is the retailer tag on the back itchy need to remove it ',\n",
       " 'this dress is simply beautiful and stunning it is so figure flattering and can wait to wear it size small worked for me and since m tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is beautiful detail ',\n",
       " ' tags sewn in small about long and huge about very itchy so cut them out then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags not comfortable at all also love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work am b cup however this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to b cup so for me this would only be lounging bralette if it wasn so itchy ',\n",
       " 'i recently got this on sale after looking at it forever on my wish list m so happy with it its very comfortable and just long enough for my torso the pattern on the front is very flattering ',\n",

       " 'just received this in the mail tried it on and am smitten m usually l but sometimes m xl if no stretch in retailer tops bought this one in and m sure glad did very flowy stretchy and comfortable also bought the meda lace top from one september and they are very similar expect this is more of t shirt and the other is more of blouse almost think could ve gotten m in this because there is lot of extra fabric at the chest which is usually never the issue for me',\n",
       " 'love this top kept eyeing it online and wavering on size since my post baby body is little wonky went with the xsp and miraculously it works perfectly so would say it does run just little large love the length and usually do not go with petite sizes at retailer because like the longer lengths of the regular but this is perfect on me and there is give up top so it looks lovely and it is very soft and comfortable this will be go to top this season ',\n",
       " 'i really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person it is soft and the patter is okay in person the neckline is higher than am used to also there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on unfortunately had to return this item ',\n",
       " 'i really wanted this to work alas it had strange fit for me the straps would not stay up and it had weird fit under the breast it worked standing up but the minute sat down it fell off my shoulders the fabric was beautiful and loved that it had pockets ',\n",
       " 'this top is so cute but it is massively babydoll shaped line which is not apparent from the pictures measured the xs have and the chest is about and sweep is over would definitely keep this top if it hung straighter the craftsmanship is lovely and fabric is so natural and handwoven looking m thinking about asking my tailor if she can take the sides in but that might ruin it as the fabric layout is cut and proportioned to this swing style ',\n",
       " 'why do designers keep making crop tops can imagine this would be flattering on anyone especially someone average height and well endowed on top looked like football player the pattern and fabric are gorgeous so if you are like tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work am between and fit small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top such weird cut there is cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so s',\n",
       " 'i have short torso and this works well for me bought the there not much stretch to the fabric so it is fitted to my chest but not in an uncomfortable way definitely doesn hang and have extra fabric like on the model zipper goes almost all the way down to the bottom so it easier to get on and off which makes up for the lack of stretch the fabric unlike another reviewer found it went really well with navy pants and wore it to business meeting under blazer wi',\n",
       " 'i love this top it is loose and comfortable it is not sheer so you don need cami it runs little large so size down if you want more tailored fit criticism it catches on sharp jewelry or belts and can pull if you are not careful ',\n",
       " 'i passed up this dress so many times in the store and finally tried it on today because wanted casual dress while traveling in the cape was surprised how much cuter it is on than on hanger sized down to get more fitting look and really made difference for me in style was not fan of the way it looked so loose on model it looks really cute fitted and bit sexy even it is lined and very comfy and can be dressed up but for work with cardi believe will get lot of wear',\n",
       " 'i am so drawn to baby doll and boxy shirts so immediately tried this on in the store am petite and only so usually shirts with lot of fabric swallow me whole but this one was still cute there is lot more fabric than the picture lets on but think it is still super cute and flattering would definitely check the size chart and read comments to see if someone with your same size description has recommended specific size for your body type am petite and weigh about lbs',\n",

       " 'i fell in love with this top sweater before it could even be ordered was on model for pants that were available to order in any case later ordered the blue motif online and the colors are even more beautiful in person the blue also contains fibers of wine so very pretty the gray is soft shade the quality is lovely too the only cons are that the seater is rather heavy but should be great for colder winter months and the zipper on the back is quite conspicuous however that said ',\n",
       " 'love the feminine styling of classic tunic tee ll wear it with black leggings this fall super cute to wear casually or dress up bit with some jewelry and or scarf ',\n",
       " 'this top is full of amazing details the photos really don do it justice it is very flowy and does run large but is so pretty and soft and in beautiful shades of blue bought small and it is fairly long in back on my frame but because of the detailing it just works ',\n",
       " 'unlike the first three reviews loved this sweater the colors were beautiful and paired it with green cords did not find the sweater to be itchy but very comfortable fits trus to size ',\n",
       " 'great fit even for busty women ordered an because usually need the room in the chest area on dresses dd fit nicely without being tight might have been able to size down but didn want to risk being too tight flattering especially on curves nice for contemporary office or special occasion if you like his designs you won be disappointed ',\n",
       " 'love this top purchased it in the coral color now m definitely wanting it in the blue since it is such great blouse for transitioning into fall the weight of the top it good since live in south texas so definitely needing lightweight long sleeves for our weather m sure when the time comes adding long cardigan or blazer over it as needed for the cooler weather it will look great fit true to size ',\n",
       " 'absolutely love this suit the bottoms are very comfortable and covers everything id like it to it does not ride up at all which almost never happens with swim suits m going to order this in different color next season paired the bottoms with the peplum top and received many compliments ',\n",
       " 'i just love this dress took me ordering number of sizes petite and regular to find the best fit might still have the top altered received lot of compliements work it with some black leather wedges for daytime work ',\n",
       " 'i got the purple color and absolutely love it am but decided against the petite size and wanted it to be bit longer also went with the xxs as the xs was bit too loose on the arm it was definitely splurge to buy the sweater but it looked so lovely ',\n",
